NAME : DIPAYAN BANIK 
PROGRAM : PIZZA MAKER

INSTRUCTIONS: Please check the make.bat before compiling. I have used apache-ant-1.10.5 which is the newest version of ant. 
			  You can also replace the apache-ant-1.10.5 by ant-1.9.9. 
		
			  The program is intially running by GUI, if you want to run it in the command line, uncomment the ant run-command-line -Ddrive-letter=%DRIVE_LETTER% 
			  in batch file. If you want to run it by GUI, do the same for ant run-gui -Ddrive-letter=%DRIVE_LETTER% 

               
              It should compile like this way : build (name of directory where your Java folder is ) < pizza_input_0.txt		

			  Have a good day!
